## New features

 Progresso aims to boost cassidoo's tool functions while keeping the _simple_ perk.
 You can:

 - Create task groups, names are limited to 4 characters and default to NEW if left blank
 ```
 group-name:task-name
 UI:Login page
 ```
 - Visualize total, paused and completed tasks
 - Visualize the date in a more compact way

```

If you're really interested in contributing I'd advise you to head up to the original project, it's well maintained and clearly coded.
